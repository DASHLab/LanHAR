# LanHAR: Large Language Model-Guided Semantic Alignment for Human Activity Recognition

---

## System Overview
**LanHAR** introduces a new paradigm for **cross-dataset human activity recognition** powered by **large language model (LLM)-driven semantic alignment**. 

LanHAR maps both sensor readings and activity labels into a **shared semantic space** through natural-language descriptions. This alignment mitigates dataset heterogeneity and enables the recognition of activities unseen during training, offering enhanced generalization across domains and sensing environments.

**Key Components**

- üß† Semantic interpretation ‚Äî generate semantic interpretations of sensor readings and activity labels. The system features a semantic interpretation generation process with an iterative re-generation method to ensure high-quality outputs.
- ‚öôÔ∏è Two-stage training framework ‚Äî transfers the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into lightweight, privacy-preserving models deployable on resource-constrained edge devices.
